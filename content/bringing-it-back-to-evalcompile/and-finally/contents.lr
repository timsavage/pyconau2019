body:

### Back to `exec`/`eval`/`compile`

- Can execute a statement
- Can produce objects/types

<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim>
def evaluate(left, right):
    return (
        (left.name is not None) 
        and (left.name == right.name)
    )
</code></pre>

notes:

- This is the part actually used in namedtuple
- A class can be defined in eval and returned as a usable type
